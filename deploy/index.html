                            <p>Contrary to his design contemporaries, Pucci was driven by the desire to liberate women, granting
                                them unprecedented freedom and movement. His simply designed dresses, pants and tops featured
                                sexy,free-flowing lines that followed the natural curves of the body. Pucci designs had the allure
                                of couture, but were shed of all the impractical weight, volume, layering and, most importantly,
                                cost of haute couture creations. Additionally, Pucci offered a total vision that ranged from dresses
                                and underwear to linens, handbags, perfumes and rugs, and gave an expanded group of consumers access
                                to designer goods for the first time.<p>

                            <p>Gianni Versace's collections were colourful, sexy and luxurious. His designs mixed baroque prints,
                                animal skin motifs, bondage-style leather, slits and, especially, ultra-tight fits. Versace became
                                internationally renowned for ultra-glamorous creations as well as spectacular theatrical costumes
                                and innovative menswear design. Versace's style combined luxurious classicism with overt sexuality.
                                His sensational advertising campaigns featured supermodels such as Linda Evangelista and Naomi
                                Campbell.<p>

                            <p>Stella Jean is an emerging Haitian-Italian fashion designer and former model, whose cultural identity
                                often provides inspiration for her eponymous label. Jean has established her signature aesthetic as
                                a merging of the exoticism of her creole heritage and the craftsmanship of her Italian roots. The
                                result is classic feminine tailoring - cinched-in waists and dirndl skirts infused with bold tribal
                                prints and colour.<p>

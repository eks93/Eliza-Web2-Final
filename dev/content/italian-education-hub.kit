    </div>


    <div id="text">
        <p>20 young designers at the end of an atypical year, 20 collections that express the complexity of our time and
            20 iconic locations in a city that will once again become the heart of a new Renaissance. Human Poetics is
            the celebration of a new beginning and an invitation for young creatives to release their visions and ideas
            in a new format.</p>
        <p>This is not a digital fashion show. It is a visual story that expresses the emotions of the students and the
            beauty of their collections. Because we cannot meet in person, Polimoda wants to unite people from all over
            the world with the feelings and sensations only fashion can convey.</p>
        <p>Polimoda is known worldwide for its independence in thinking and action by combining business and design
            across all departments. Considered one of the best fashion institutes in the world, Polimoda balances the
            know-how of Italian design and production with an international vision.</p>

           <p>Amato Daniele creates exclusive bags and accessories 100% handmade by skillful artisans in the heart of Milano, inside his family’s factory, Leu Locati. The Fall-Winter 21/22 collection perfectly reps the designer’s style where novelties and tradition coexist. Must-have as usual, the iconic Mesh fabric, a twine of metallic threads plated real 24 kt gold and silver made with an ancient hand-operated loom.</p>
